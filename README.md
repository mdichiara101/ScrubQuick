# ScrubQuick
 IOS Native Application

This was a project I started back in October 2020. This is the first IOS app I have created. It is very simple survey taking app for a carpet cleaning company called scrubquick. I have came a long way from this app over the months I've learned swift/swiftUI. It is a good example of how much I've grown from this app to HTX Farmers Markets which is my second IOS app.

The project is simple you choose the schedule appointment button then you will be given some options for what survey you would like to take.

Each survey has different list of questions the user has to answer that have to do with the age and condition the item the user wants to be cleaned is in.

Once you are done with the survey, you can either submit the survey where it will open up an email directed to one of the companies employees or you can start another survey.

If you start another survey, each survey will be stacked on one another in the final submission email.

This project is basically me learning swift and storyboards. I didn't even use a navigation bar in this project for some reason I decided to build my own through buttons. 

I'll probably rebuild this project in the future once I'm done with a couple more projects. It will be interesting to see a before and after.
